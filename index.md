## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Javi! ðŸ˜Š I'm a software engineer with a career spanning since 2006. Over the years, I've been involved in diverse projects, ranging from public administration and healthcare systems to gambling and ride hailing.

Currently, I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Cabify](https://cabify.com/). I have previous experience at Indra Software Labs or Recreativos Franco S.L accumulating valuable experience in various domains, including public administration, healthcare and gambling.

## ðŸ”§ Skills

My strong focus on product and user experience is complemented by strategic thinking and decision making. My passion for technology has led me to work with a variety of  programming languages, including C#, Java, Elixir, Node, and Golang. I've tackled projects with different architectural paradigms, from monolithic structures to microservices and event-driven architectures.

## ðŸ“š Lifelong Learner

I thrive on continuous learning and enjoy staying abreast of the latest technological advancements. Adapting to new challenges and exploring emerging technologies is a constant part of my journey. I'm currently eager to channel my enthusiasm for technology into contributing to open-source projects. I find fulfillment in collaborating with the community and giving back to the broader ecosystem.
