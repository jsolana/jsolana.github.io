👋 Hello, I'm Javi! 😊 I'm a software engineer with a career spanning since 2006. Over the years, I've been involved in diverse projects, ranging from public administration and healthcare systems to gambling and ride hailing.

## 💼 Work Experience

**Currently**, I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Cabify](https://cabify.com/). I have previous experience at Indra Software Labs or Recreativos Franco S.L accumulating valuable experience in various domains, including public administration, healthcare and gambling.

## 🔧 Skills

My strong focus on product and user experience is complemented by strategic thinking and decision making. My passion for technology has led me to work with a variety of  programming languages, including C#, Java, Elixir, Node, and Golang. I've tackled projects with different architectural paradigms, from monolithic structures to microservices and event-driven architectures.

## 📚 Lifelong Learner

I thrive on continuous learning and enjoy staying abreast of the latest technological advancements. Adapting to new challenges and exploring emerging technologies is a constant part of my journey. I'm currently eager to channel my enthusiasm for technology into contributing to open-source projects. I find fulfillment in collaborating with the community and giving back to the broader ecosystem.


If you'd like to connect or discuss technology, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javier-solana-huertas-1156a99). 

I'm excited about the journey ahead and the endless possibilities in the world of software engineering! 💪
