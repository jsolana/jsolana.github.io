### Hackathon experience ðŸŽ‰

Recently, I had the fantastic opportunity to join our companyâ€™s annual event, Kenya, a hackathon where all the engineers come together, collaborate, and dive into creative projects. This year, I was lucky enough to work on something that truly took me back to my roots in programming: collaborate designing a game engine in **Raylib Go** and creating a game based on our daily life in the office.

The [engine](https://github.com/apoloval/pctk) we created is especially suited for point-and-click adventure games, and it has some SCUMM-inspired mechanics to capture that classic feel.

### Hereâ€™s a Sneak Peek at the Result ðŸŽ¥

Check out the trailer for our project below:

### Rediscovering My Love for Game Development ðŸŽ®

The funny thing is almost 12 years ago, I completed a course as a video game development expert, diving deep into **Ogre** and **C++** to create a 3D mini-golf game. Hereâ€™s a trailer of that earlier project:

Coming back to game development after all these years was like reconnecting with that spark that got me into programming as a kid. This hackathon reminded me of the pure joy of creating something interactive and visual from scratch, and it left me wanting more!

There are still plenty of exciting ideas left to implement to bring this project to its full potential. Hereâ€™s a look at some of the key features weâ€™re aiming to add:

- **Object Border Debugging**: Enhancing visual clarity for object boundaries during testing.
- **Scaling Adjustments**: Investigating solutions to improve current scaling issues.
- **Game State & Save Functionality**: Implementing save/load options to preserve player progress.
- **Configuration Support**: Adding settings for music, language, and other options for a personalized experience.
- **Image-Based Inventory**: Creating a more immersive inventory interface with images.
- **Custom Actor Animations**: Enabling animations not tied to specific actions for greater flexibility.
- So on...
