This repository serves as a personal blog and knowledge repository, enabling me to share professional challenges and lessons learned. By reflecting on daily experiences, I aim to refine my writing and make these insights accessible to others.

## Local Development

This repository is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a simple, blog-aware static site generator. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal space for documenting and reflecting on professional experiences, challenges, and ongoing learning. By sharing these insights, the goal is to enhance my writing skills, retain important knowledge, and combat the inevitable process of forgetting.

To run the site locally, ensure you have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) installed, then execute the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

and browse to `http://localhost:4000`.

Take look to the [official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information.
